## Welcome to the Graduate ECE (GREECE) @ UT Homepage

[Resources](resources) [Board](board) [Corporate](corporate)

The purpose of the Graduate ECE (GREECE) is to interact with ECE graduate students across labs and tracks and foster a sense of community within the UT Graduate ECE department. We host social events, industry events, and provide a voice to the administration on graduate student needs.

We have tons of fun events planned for the Fall 2018/Spring 2019 school year so stay in touch! We'll have a calendar up soon.

### Stay Connected

We have two ways to stay connected:

- [Mailing List](https://utlists.utexas.edu/sympa/info/greece/): used for event updates
- [Slack Channel](https://bit.ly/utecegradslack): used for communicating with fellow Graduate ECE students.
